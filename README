Ghana Rental Project 🏠 🇬🇭

Welcome to the Ghana Rental Project, where data meets real estate! Our mission is to provide a comprehensive database of house rentals in Accra, Ghana, powered by cutting-edge technology. Explore, analyze, and make informed decisions in the vibrant Accra rental market.

## Project Overview

Integrating Apache Spark with Amazon Redshift, we've harnessed the power of data to simplify the rental experience. Here's what our project entails:

### Data Extraction and Ingestion
- Collect rental data from diverse sources, structured into CSV files.

### Amazon S3 as Staging Area
- Utilize Amazon S3 as a scalable and cost-effective storage intermediary, bridging Spark and Redshift.

### ETL Process with Spark
- Leverage Apache Spark for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes, efficiently handling vast datasets. Spark's libraries clean, transform, and enrich your data.

### Data Transformation
- Shape and clean data during ETL to fit Redshift's schema.

### Data Deduplication and Enrichment
- Eliminate duplicates and enhance data quality using Spark.

### Loading Data into Redshift
- Effortlessly load transformed data into Amazon Redshift, with options like the COPY command or AWS Glue.

### Data Warehouse Schema Design
- Design Redshift schema for optimal analytical query performance.

### Running Analytical Queries
- Leverage Redshift's SQL capabilities for data analysis and reporting.

### Monitoring and Optimization
- Continuously optimize Spark jobs, Redshift queries, and the system for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

### Security and Access Control
- Prioritize data privacy with AWS IAM roles and Redshift user permissions.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery
- Implement robust backup and recovery strategies to safeguard against data loss.
