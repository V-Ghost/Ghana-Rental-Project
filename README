🏠 Ghana Rental Project 🇬🇭

Welcome to the Ghana Rental Project, where data meets real estate! Our mission is to provide a comprehensive database of house rentals in Accra, Ghana, powered by cutting-edge technology. Explore, analyze, and make informed decisions in the vibrant Accra rental market.

🔍 Project Overview
Integrating Apache Spark with Amazon Redshift, we've harnessed the power of data to simplify the rental experience. Here's what our project entails:

📦 **Data Extraction and Ingestion**:
   - Collect rental data from diverse sources, structured into CSV files.

💾 **Amazon S3 as Staging Area**:
   - Utilize Amazon S3 as a scalable and cost-effective storage intermediary, bridging Spark and Redshift.

🚀 **ETL Process with Spark**:
   - Leverage Apache Spark for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes, efficiently handling vast datasets. Spark's libraries clean, transform, and enrich your data.

🧹 **Data Transformation**:
   - Shape and clean data during ETL to fit Redshift's schema.

🔄 **Data Deduplication and Enrichment**:
   - Eliminate duplicates and enhance data quality using Spark.

📥 **Loading Data into Redshift**:
   - Effortlessly load transformed data into Amazon Redshift, with options like the COPY command or AWS Glue.

🏢 **Data Warehouse Schema Design**:
   - Design Redshift schema for optimal analytical query performance.

📊 **Running Analytical Queries**:
   - Leverage Redshift's SQL capabilities for data analysis and reporting.

🔍 **Monitoring and Optimization**:
   - Continuously optimize Spark jobs, Redshift queries, and the system for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

🔐 **Security and Access Control**:
   - Prioritize data privacy with AWS IAM roles and Redshift user permissions.

💼 **Backup and Disaster Recovery**:
   - Implement robust backup and recovery strategies to safeguard against data loss.
